\section{Concurrency Solution}
\subsection{What do you think the main point of the assignment was?}
The main point of the assignment was to get more experience with thinking about
concurrency, and thinking in the parallel programming paradigm when designing solutions.  
\subsection{How did you personally approach the problem?}
At first we did research to get some background information on the producer
consumer problem. Once we had a good background of the problem we were able to
get started implementing the solution. As far as the implementation went the main
components consisted of the producer function, the consumer function and the
buffer. We began to work on implementing these components one by one until the
program converged in the end. 
\subsection{How did you ensue your solution was correct?}
We ensued that our solution was correct by printing the values that were
produced by the producer and consumed by the consumer. 
\subsection{What did you learn?}
As a group we learned how to use pthreads at a higher level than before. This
assignment also gave me a better understanding of parallel programming. 
\section{Qemu Command-Line Flags}
\begin{itemize}
	\item -gdb tcp::5601 - Open a GDB server on TCP port 5601
	\item -S - Do not start the CPU at startup.
	\item -nographic - Disables graphical output so that QEMU is a command line operation.
	\item -kernel linux-yocto-4.14/arch/x86/boot/bzImage - Uses this bzImage as a kernel image.
	\item -drive file=core-image-quemux86.ext3 - Defines a new drive with the file option set.
	\item if=virtio
	\item -enable-kvm - Enables KVM virtualization report.
	\item -net none - Indicates that no network devices should be configured.
	\item -usb - Enables the USB driver.
	\item -localtime - Gives the local time.
	\item -- no-reboot
	\item -- apend "root=/dev/vda rw console=ttyS0 debug" - Uses the argument as the kernel command line.
